            For this project, we were assigned to create a website to enter into the Trauma Association Of America's National Injury Prevention Day contest
            .To enter into this contest you had to create any form of media describing what safety looks like in our community. For this website, we created 
            four pages of content all detailing different forms of safety and how they could be achieved. We had a “Safe Choices”, “Safe Cities”, “Safe Homes” 
            and “Safe Schools” page. To create this website, my partner and I had to use HTML and CSS to visually represent our design. We designed the website
             using Figma as well as actual physical prototyping.

            This was our first assignment in which we needed to create a full-scale website. 
            During the creation of this website, I developed a better understanding of CSS formatting.
            The design required a much deeper understanding of CSS. Although at this point I had some experience with CSS, 
            this project forced me to style a page correctly. For this project, I also had to do lots of investigation / research. 
            My partner and I were limited with a 600 word limit for each page of content. Due to this limit, every sentence mattered.
             We had to do lots of research to find meaningful content and sources.
