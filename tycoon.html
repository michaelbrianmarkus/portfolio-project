            This is a project I decided to work on my own during my freetime
             to improve my JavaScript skills. This is a 'Tycoon' style game in which the goal is
             to acquire lots of money, my game is based around the style of “Minecraft”. This in the sense that blocks are mined and used
              as a currency system and a pixelated style is used but it is made in a way which is copyright compliant. This project used HTML, CSS,
             SCSS (a variant of CSS), and JavaScript.

            Similarly to the Sorry project, this project required lots of JavaScript to create a functioning game.
            A challenging part of this project was actually completing it in a reasonable amount of time. Due to the fact that
            this was completely on my own time, It was pretty easy to just not work on it when I felt discouraged or confused 
            because of any programming issues. I had to learn how to persist and complete the project despite my own resistance.
            Inversely though, the lack of any time limit allowed me to have lots of time to come up with ideas, write quality code, 
            and make sure everything was working as intended.
