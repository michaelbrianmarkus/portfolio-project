            For this project, we were assigned to create a website to raise awareness about a social issue and advocate for change. We were able to choose any topic, 
            and I decided to go with Phishing. My website consisted of two pages, one page dedicated to giving information about the topic of phishing and another page
            dedicated to giving individual tips and strategies to fight against phishing.

            This assignment was after our National Injury Prevention day project, 
            so we have already developed a fundamental understanding of CSS styling / structuring. The website
            was like the other three sites constructed with HTML and CSS and designed with Figma.
            This was also an individual project so I had to
            initiate and ensure I had a plan for every single aspect or else the website wouldn't be good.
