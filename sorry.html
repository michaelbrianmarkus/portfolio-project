            For our sorry project, we were assigned to create an online rendition of a board game. We had to choose a board game then make one or more changes to the gameplay of the original
            board game. Our group decided to go with the Sorry board game. We chose to alter this game by implementing event spaces and a shop-system. Our reasoning was that the event-spaces 
            could be an extra element of chaos and thus fun to the game while the shop-system and the items that accompany it allow for an element of player choice / strategy. To create this game,
            we had to use HTML, CSS and Javascript.

            Similarly to the Sorry project, this project required lots of JavaScript to create a functioning game. A challenging part of this project was actually completing it in a reasonable 
            amount of time. Due to the fact that this was completely on my own time, It was pretty easy to just not work on it when I felt discouraged or confused because of any programming issues
            . I had to learn how to persist and complete the project despite my own resistance. Inversely though, the lack of any time limit allowed me to have lots of time to come up with ideas,
            write quality code, and make sure everything was working as intended.
