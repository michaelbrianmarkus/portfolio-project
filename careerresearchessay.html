        Career Of Choice Research Essay
        Introduction

        I initially became interested in software-engineering as a career option two or three years ago. This was after I got my own personal computer. I am interested in this career because for most of my childhood and life in general, I have used and enjoyed computers frequently. This computer use has not given me much of a leg-up when it comes to software engineering knowledge, but rather it has made me very interested in software-engineering and the computer processes associated with it. I recommend this career to people who are interested in computers and have an aptitude for engineering due to the high salary and flexible work options. 
        Career Duties
        
        Software engineers generally have varying career duties and responsibilities depending on whatever type of project they are working on. Software engineers focus on applying the principles of engineering to software development (Software Engineer Job Description). This is a very open-ended description for a very open-ended career. Software engineers are expected to use varying technologies / methods in order to create digital programs. Some more specific duties of software engineers include “evaluating and testing new software programs, optimizing software for speed and scalability, writing and testing code, consulting with clients, engineers, security specials, and other stakeholders, and presenting new features to stakeholders and internal customers” (What Does A Software Engineer Do?). Software engineers are expected to be knowledgeable enough to solve problems and create varying programs using proper technology. The specific technology used by a software engineer can vary from person to person, but there are some general coding languages that are important to know within the software engineering field. These include Python, Java, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc. Software engineers will be expected to use varying tools, these tools appeal to those who are interested in computers and the processes associated.
