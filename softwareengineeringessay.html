        A full stack developer is a developer who is able to code for both the front-end and back-end. The ‘front-end’, means visible elements of a website, the graphical interface. Front-end code developers use code to visibly represent things. On the contrary, ‘back-end’ developers code systems that may not be visible or intended for users to see. A good metaphor is a car. The metaphorical front-end developers of the car would work to make the interior and exterior look nice (or whatever the contractor wants). In this hypothetical car, the paint-job, the type of seat, the windows, the material used for the steering wheel, etc. would all be chosen and implemented by the front-end developer. As it follows, the ‘back-end’ developer of this hypothetical car would develop and manage the systems within the car. They would focus on optimizing the engine, the raw power, increasing the lifespan, etc. Back-end developers create the underlying systems which front-end developers work to visually represent. For every website that is pretty, there is a system that stores data, speedily fetches you information, etc. Back-end developers are necessary to upkeep / develop these systems.  
        According to ‘indeed’, a job-hiring website, the average salary of a full-stack developer is $111,293. This figure is retrieved through information based on 11,238 anonymous reports from employers and users in the field. The average salary of a front-end developer is $107,443, while the average salary of a back-end developer is $115,667. Although this source shows that back-end developers on average make more, this is just an average and there are many reasons why people listed as ‘back-end developers’ make more. Firstly, full-stack developers make more than front-end developers, which is expected, but it may be confusing as why back-end developers would make more than full-stack developers despite the fact that full-stack developers are supposed to be well versed in the back-end and front-end. A theory I have is that full-stack developers on average may have more knowledge than a typical front-end developer but those who are going to back-end development most likely are very well versed into the back-end. I assume most self-proclaimed ‘full-stack developers’ who list themselves at that are fairly decent at both but back end developers are those who know truly cutting edge tactics and technology relating to back-end systems, thus skewing the data. I think overall it would make sense that becoming a full stack developer would increase your chances of a good salary, but in this data it isn’t clear.
